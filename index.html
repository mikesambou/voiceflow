    <main>
        <h2>Welcome to the Incident Response Learning Tool</h2>
        <p>Our chatbot guides students through a hands-on course designed to teach them the fundamentals of incident response as a Site Reliability Engineer. Through interactive scenarios, learners develop essential skills in diagnosing and resolving system issues that can impact service reliability and uptime.</p>
        
        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>The chatbot uses guided discovery, walking students through realistic incident scenarios where they must make decisions based on their knowledge. By providing feedback on their choices, the chatbot helps learners understand the best practices and techniques used by professionals in the field.</p>
        
        <h2>Motivational Support</h2>
        <p>To keep students motivated, the chatbot uses the random quotes API to generate an inspiring quote at the start of each task. These quotes help encourage learners to stay focused and complete their tasks with enthusiasm.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Choose This Approach?</h2>
        <p>Guided discovery enables students to learn by doing, which reinforces their understanding of key concepts. The use of motivational quotes ensures that learners remain engaged throughout the course, making the experience both educational and enjoyable.</p>
